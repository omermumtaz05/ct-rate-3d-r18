This repository contains code for a 3D ResNet18 model I trained and tested using a small portion of the CT-RATE labels dataset.
In the code, I used PyTorch and implemented data augmentation on underrepresented labels due to the dataset being imbalanced.
I also implemented early stopping to track when the losses converge.
